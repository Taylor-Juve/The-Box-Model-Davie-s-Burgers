# The-Box-Model-Davie-s-Burgers
Codecademy's Fundamentals of CSS project on the Box Model.

I did some extra work because I thought the site would look better with a header near the bottom of the background image. I learned about position property and top then used it and it does look better!

Update: Just learned "float" property and this is better suited for my orginal thought however using position makes for a better location than float so I'll keep it.
